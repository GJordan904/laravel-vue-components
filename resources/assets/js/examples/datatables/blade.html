            This component is a wrapper around the jQuery DataTables plugin and handles instantiating a DataTables
            instance and building out the html for you. All that is needed is to pass a data object or a route for
            the ajax request and the component handles the rest. Additional options may be passed to the component
            as props that are then passed on to the DataTables instance.

        <h2>Page Component</h2>
        <p>
            This page is setup in a split style where some of the markup is contained in the blade template and
            some is contained inside the component. Personally, I find it easier to maintain everything in one area and I have
            simply done this for demonstration purposes.
